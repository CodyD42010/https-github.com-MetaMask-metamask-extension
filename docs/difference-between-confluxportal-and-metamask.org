* Differences between ConfluxPortal and MetaMask
Feel free to [[https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-portal/issues/new/choose][submit issues]] for any question.
** Injected
MetaMask inject a ~window.web3~ (deprecated since 2020-01-13) and a
~window.ethereum~ in user pages. The corresponding conflux global variables are
~window.confluxJS~ and ~window.conflux~

MetaMask has the api ~window.ethereum.isMetaMask~ for developer to check if the
metamask version of provider is avalible. ConfluxPortal change that to
~window.conflux.isConfluxPortal~.
