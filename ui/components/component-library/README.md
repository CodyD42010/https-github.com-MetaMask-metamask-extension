# Component Library

This folder contains new design system components that will be used for the IA/Nav redesign work. They are currently a WIP and should not be used for feature work. That should change in the near future but for the time being please use existing UI components in `ui/components/ui`

If internal folks have any questions please reach out the design system team via the internal slack channel [#metamask-design-system](https://consensys.slack.com/archives/C0354T27M5M)
