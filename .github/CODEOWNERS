# The .circleci/ folder instructs Circle CI on the process by which it
# should test, build and publish releases of our application. Due to the
# impact that changes to the files contained within this folder may have
# on our releases, only those with the knowledge and responsibility to 
# publish libraries under the MetaMask name may approve those changes.
# Note to reviewers: We employ the use of CircleCI "Orbs", which are
# remotely hosted sections of CircleCI configuration and scripts, to
# empower our CI steps. ANY addition of orbs to our CircleCI config
# should be brought to the attention of engineering leadership for
# discussion
