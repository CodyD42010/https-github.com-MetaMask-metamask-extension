MetaMask is a developer beta. To us, that means there are some issues we want to resolve before it's easy for normal people to stay safe when using MetaMask.

Most notably, right now when you log in to MetaMask, your current account is visible to every new site you visit.

This doesn't mean new sites can spend your funds, but it does mean they can associate IP addresses with certain addresses if you don't lock MetaMask between uses.

For your privacy, lock up MetaMask when you're done using a site. We're working hard to add better security around things like this all the time.
