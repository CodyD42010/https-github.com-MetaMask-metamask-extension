# Icon images

The svg icons in this folder work directly with the `<Icon />` component in `ui/components/component-library/icon/icon.js`.

It works in conjunction with the generate icon names script in `development/generate-icon-names.js` to display all of the icons in this folder.

## IMPORTANT!!

If you are not intending for your svg image to be used with the `<Icon />` component **DO NOT** add it to this folder. For more information read the `<Icon />` component [README.mdx](../../../ui/components/component-library/icon/README.mdx) or checkout the [storybook](https://metamask.github.io/metamask-storybook/index.html?path=/story/ui-components-component-library-icon-icon-stories-js--default-story)
