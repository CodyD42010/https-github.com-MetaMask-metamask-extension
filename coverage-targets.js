// Codecov uses a yaml file for its configuration and it targets line coverage.
// To keep our policy in place we have thile file separate from our
// codecov.yml file that specifies coverage targets for each project in the
// codecov.yml file. These targets are read by the test/merge-coverage.js
// script, and the paths from the codecov.yml file are used to figure out which
// subset of files to check against these targets.
